            <Title order={3}>More things you need to know about Heat Press!</Title>
            <Title order={3}>1. How does a heat press machine work?</Title>
            <Text>A heat press machine can work as a home iron, which transmits heat producing all over the surface of the plate to fabrics. When crafters are dying to perfectly transfer their desired pictures to a variety of projects, a heat press helps complete the process by offering fast and even heat with a proper force.

            </Text>
            <Text>But compared with a home iron, the heat press features better temperature control, a much more even ironing plate, and a built-in timer to ensure more professional results.
            </Text>

            <Text>Normally, heat presses are compatible with certain crafting materials like heat transfer vinyl, sublimation paper, and heat transfer paper. These are special materials that need heat to melt the vinyl and sublimation ink.</Text>

            <Title order={3}>2. How to use a heat press machine?
            </Title>
            <Text>Many heat presses will offer instructions in their package for correct operation. Actually, it’s quite easy to put a heat press into practice. </Text>
            <Text>For most crafting materials working with a heat press, crafters usually need to make their designs on a computer and mirror the images if it’s heat transfer vinyl or sublimation paper and does not mirror if it's heat transfer paper. </Text>
            <Text>Connect the computer with a cutter and cut the designs with it when you work with heat transfer vinyl. Connect a printer and print your vibrant designs when you work with sublimation paper or heat transfer paper. Whether the latter need to be cut with a cutter after printing depends on the needs of crafters.</Text>
            <Text>Then, weed away the excess parts from the cut design with weeding tools like tweezers, weeder, and scrap collector. You will get the exact images that you want. </Text>
            <Text>Prepare the items you’re about to craft and a Teflon sheet or a sheet of parchment paper in advance. Put your item, designs, and a Teflon sheet or a sheet of parchment paper orderly on the heating mat, and then set a proper temperature and time according to your materials on the heat press. </Text>
            <Text>Now, let’s get our heat press into use! Preheat the heat press machine to the set temperature, iron your items before heat pressing to make sure it’s wrinkle-free, and transfer the images onto the surface of the items with an appropriate force. When the time is out, remove everything on the design and peel off the protective film when it has cooled down. The work is done! And you can sufficiently enjoy what your hands made for you!</Text>
            <Title order={3}>3. Types of Heat Press Machines</Title>
            <Text>In the past, professionals used to get themselves a big, heavy, and traditional heat press machine. Nowadays, a variety of stylish heat presses are bursting up out of the market. For bringing crafters lots more convenience and portability, we can see there are mini heat presses tinier than an adult hat. In order to enhance the efficiency of heat transfer, easy heat presses are found close in our daily lives. And this year, 2023, high-tech auto heat presses even show up in front of the whole world.</Text>
            <Title order={3}>4. What to consider when choosing the best Heat Press Machine?</Title>
            <Title order={5}>Manual vs. Automatic</Title>
            <Text>Different types of heat presses will serve you with different working experiences. Normally, we see traditional big heat presses on the market, which are suitable for large projects. As time goes by, there are more delicate, safe, and portable heat presses bubbling from the market. But most of these machines are for manual operation, which means they all need to work under imposed pressure. Therefore, the heat pressing process could be a little bit complicated and arduous. </Text>
            <Text>Now, a new type of heat press has come out with a high-tech appearance: Auto Heat Press. Compared with manual ones, this type of heat press must save crafters lots of effort and time while pressing and can make sure better-transferring effects.</Text>
            <Text>But of course, we can tell from the functions and concept of these machines that manual ones are much cheaper. If you are not a professional and don’t have a high budget for the machine, it’s recommended to choose a better value one from the manual kinds.</Text>
            <Title order={5}>Heat Performance</Title>
            <Text>For making excellent finished works, the most important property of a heat press is its even heating performance. This characteristic will affect whether or not the materials are being transferred completely. Many heat presses on the market, according to the test and comparison, only emit heat and display different temperature values on parts of the heating plate. Using these heat presses, the results will be hard to perform as you expected.</Text>
            <Title order={5}>Heating Speed</Title>
            <Text>Except for even heat as required, how long will the heating plate take to reach the set temperature is also a crucial concern. Rapid heating makes the working process flow smoothly and therefore, helps reduce the frustration of crafters. Meanwhile, it saves precious time waiting to preheat and apply.</Text>
