            <Text>There is no doubt that the heat press is designed to apply heat and pressure within a predetermined period of time to emboss designs or graphics on substrates, such as T-shirts, canvas bags, school bags, puzzles, etc. Cricut shirt press is the most common. Using a easy press cricut for heat transfer is a way to ensure accurate time, temperature and pressure, which are essential for the transfer process. So, how to set the temperature of the Cricurt heat press correctly?
            </Text>
            <Text>Please refer to the Cricut Heat Press Temperature Guide/easy press heat guide below:
            </Text>
            <Text>Through these two forms of Cricut Heat Press Settings, you will notice that different vinyl types are listed at the top of the page. Then the different materials you can use are listed at the bottom of the page.
            </Text>
            <Text>Please find the correct temperature and time to set your easy press according to the Cricut Easypress heat guide/easy press heat guide, find the type of vinyl you are using on the top row, and slide your finger down until you reach the row of the material you are pressing.
            </Text>
            <Text>The first number listed of the easy press heat guide is the temperature you will press easily, and the second number of the easy press heat guideis the time you press it.
            </Text>
            <Text>If there is a X in the easy press heat guide, it means that the vinyl type is not recommended for the listed materials.
            </Text>
            <Text>Most of the vinyls listed are cool peels. This means that after you finish pressing, let the vinyl cool down before removing the carrier plate. But there are some exceptions. If the vinyl is warm leather, it will be listed on the worksheet.

            </Title>
            <Text>It is recommended that you buy cushions for Cricut . For a long time, I only used towels when using Cricut, and the heat transfer vinyl was applied very well. But when I bought the cushions for Cricut, it made it easier for me to align my design with shirts or other items because I can see the contour of the cushion. The cushion can also be placed inside the shirt to prevent any leakage that may occur when using Cricut Infusible ink. if you are looking for heat press machine near me, htvront mini heat press is a good choice!</Text>

                Easypress is essentially a heat press-people also call it Cricut Iron Press. Most ordinary irons have hot spots, and Easypress has an advanced heating plate design, so the heat always remains the same.

            <Title order={3}>8. How is EasyPress different from using a household iron?</Title>
            <Text>Using a household iron to apply heat-activated vinyl, although it is common, is very inefficient, because the heat is uneven, and most household irons have steam holes at the bottom, which further prevents the even distribution of heat.</Text>

            <Text>With a household iron, you will never know the exact temperature of the exact area to be pressed. This means that when you iron with an iron, although some areas may get the required heat, other areas may not.</Text>

            <Text>In addition, the area of an ordinary iron is set to allow control of the shape of small places, (because it is designed to iron clothes and reach small areas). However, although it is a good thing when ironing shirts, it is not what when we try to iron When pressing vinyl into clothes. The heat press usually has a square or rectangular shape, and the heat is evenly distributed across the surface to provide high-quality transmission.
                Unlike ordinary industrial printing presses, EasyPress 2 is easy to transport due to its lightweight plastic body and safe movable base.
